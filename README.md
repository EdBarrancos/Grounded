# Grounded

Grounded is a Discord made to put badbehaved Discord Users in their place!!!!!!

Jokes, Just a fun little Project

## Usage

[Get the Link in this Link. Inception, I know](bot_info.json)

Copy Paste it into your browser

Select the server when  those bad behaved users need to ***KNOW WHOSE BOSS***

And Done, I promise I want hack your server or anything, the bot is actually very **good behaved** ;)

If the bot isn't online when u do this, *Im so sorry*, I'll try to fix it or mail me

### Commands and Usage

With this bot you can define a text and voice channel and a role  as your server's grounded channels and role

Only those with the Role may see the text channel and so forth

You can define already existant ones **(DT -> Define Text Channel, DV -> Define Voice Channel, DR -> Define Role)** or ask the bot to create your own **(CT -> Create Text Channel, CV -> Create Voice Channel, CR -> Create Role)**.

You can then add the Grounded Role to Channels **(AR (member))**. As for default the Role will be removed after one minute, but can be ajusted **(ST -> Set timer)** *If it is defined as -1, the role won't be removed automatically*. The role can be removed manually too **(RR (member))**

You can mute all members with the Role and Unmute **(MM -> Mute All Grounded Members, UM -> Unmute all Grounded Members)**. Don't Forget to Unmute while you are connected to voice.

You can also move all Grounded members to the Voice Channel **(MV)**
